        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>
          <strong><em>Background:</em></strong><br>
          I have a BSBA with a major in finance from the University of Denver
          and also completed the one year MBA program at DU with a concentration
          in finance and investment management. I graduated with Honors and
          Distinction in June 2012. I have experience with financial research,
          portfolio management, mortgages, credit, marketing, and sales.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong><em>Programming:</em></strong><br>
          In February 2015 the investment company that I work for offered to
          sponsor me to go to programming school in order to turn the economic
          and investment models I was working on into usable software. While the
          school primarily focuses on the Ruby and Rails languages, we also learn
          everything from Sinatra to JavaScript. My anticipated graduation date
          is December 2015, at which point I will begin working on a way to
          evaluate Federal Reserve economic models. The goal is to write a program
          that can automatically update the models with new data and to provide
          a user-friendly interface for employees and clients to access and view
          that information.
